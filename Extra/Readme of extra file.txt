As i like the "did you know?" part:

This is the original Lamothe map for Half-Life.


What can i say about it?

Simple: it was mean't to be a multiplayer map only.

TWHL hosted a competition or community even to make a map centered around teleportation / teleporters.

I made this map, but i was around the 2019 electric crisis in Venezuela and i did not enjoy much of the creation of it due to the circumstance.

Add up the fact that it didn't have any playtesting, well... that... i turned up the map a week before deadline, left it there.

Analyzing the map years later, it wasn't badly texture or light even, it was just not a good multiplayer map.

I thank urby_nebula / Urby for being another one of the people that kindle my passion for mapping/level design.

And also to Admer for helping me back in the day.


I left this as an extra so you can see, well, an interesting fact of the meme mapper of Quake mapping community, exactly... me.


Info i recall in specific:
- Made in 2019.
- It was made in 2 weeks.
- Admer helped me with the Lighting.
- No playtesting due to circumstances.
- Was mean't to be a Black Mesa portal incident that became a Multiplayer fight "arena"
- It's 6 connected areas in total if i remember correctly, altho it was mean't to be 8.
- It doesn't have a singleplayer spawn, it does have multiplayer spawns, for SP spawn you actually need to cheat.
- SOMEHOW after HL update for some reason a part of the ramp of the "dumpster" part makes the player noclip out of the map... this was solid when i made it but welp.

Thanks to Admer, urby_nebula, TWHL, and Valve for making my favorite games of all time.

A small tribute from me, a look in the past to see how much i've progressed.

Kind regards.
Excelsior!
