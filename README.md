# WIP Alkaline 1.2 Devkit map : Lamothe

by Chuma

## What's necessary?

Download Alkaline 1.2B

https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/alkaline.62/

This is a recommended step so there isn't anything missing.

After that download the v1.2.1b devkit version from Fabio's (bmFbr) Github:

tracks used in chronological order:
"Hopeless" - DevSEb

Thank you to the respective artists!

There's possibly a bug when destroying a turret and making it fall into the ground, the image will get stuck but nothing beyond that.

Also the map due to a qc file might crash in VKQuake.
