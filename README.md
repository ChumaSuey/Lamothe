## About the map
Long time ago in 2019, i decided to make a Half-Life multiplayer map for a competition in TWHL community, as a fun nod, things weren't going well and i didn't even know what feedback i could've gotten, years later i could talk to who organized that competition (also friend) monster_urby or urby for short, he told me the feedback i wish i could've heard in 2019 but i was a different person, so... for a while Fabio has been encouraging me to map for Alkaline, having finished most "campaign levels" or official mod levels, i decided to step ahead and start.

iYago fixed the HL textures in TexMex so the color palette transparecy could work in Quake engine, and well i decided to explore the original map i've made to get idea of the textures and places i wanted to "import".

The original map should be in this github or in the slipseer release but i imported all places or worked them out in the map, working with Alkaline enemy roster and going ahead was really fun, just the map turned out longer than i expected, but i had fun nonetheless!

I thank you Admer and Urby for encouraging me in the mapping journey years ago and look where i am now! i'm very happy and excited you guys can play this!

The only note is that Forte in his playthrough got an occasional crash in VKQuake due to a qc file, while Fabio, Forte and me trying to look into the issue we got no clue on it, but it seems to be random.

The map was playtested in Ironwail, QSS and JoeQuake across the team of friends that always collaborate with me.

There are 2 possible bugs : 
- SNG can get "stuck" shooting super slowly.
- Turrets when dying or being destroyed can have their explosions stay as an image, it kinda fixes itself but yeah, not much to say there, it's beningn

tracks used in chronological order:
"Hopeless" - DevSEb

"Concrete" - DevSEb

### "The Disciples of Shub Niggurath" special thanks

I have frequent people that help me on with my maps, so it is with coding projects, so i decided to make a small group list(non-related or attached) of those that help me, the intention is that it sounds like a band, so, i'll list it as it was written with some modifications (this is some sort of "wholesome meme", don't worry, just Chuma being Chuma/ myself being myself):


- Chuma (main mapper)
- Forte (Co mapper and designer, helps a lot)
- CommonCold (Co mapper and designer also Deadpool, helps a lot)
- EmeraldTiger (Co mapper and designer also a Kamen Raider, helps a lot but has a Kamen raider suit more points)
- bmFbr (Technical/Coding/design assistance , John Carmack in disguise but he denies it)
- Admer (Technical/Coding/design assistance, if bm is John Carmack, Admer is an Eldritch entity)
- Makkon (Art assistance , Adrian Carmack would be proud except he hasn't made a statue)
- MopeyBloke (Tester, he da best bug finder and feedback)
- RecycledOJ (Compatibility tester, He is the only one using Quakespasm and not the spiked one)
- Yuyi and Alunadrern (They are my best friends but they actually give me RGB values when i ask them for feedback and help (FOG and Sky values), so in theory they are the "Sun and moon" of "Chuma's Quake maps universe" {Thanks for this joke Admer}
